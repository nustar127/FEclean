              Lumina Clean began in a small garden studio, fueled by a simple frustration: why do
              the strongest cleaners smell like chemicals and damage our lungs? We spent years
              partnering with biochemists to develop a proprietary line of clinical-grade solutions
              infused with plant-based botanical essences.

              Today, we serve the city's most discerning homes and workspaces, delivering a level of
              purity that is felt as much as it is seen. We treat every surface like a canvas and
              every room like a sanctuary.
